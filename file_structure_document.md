### Introduction

In software development, a well-organized file structure is essential for efficient development and seamless collaboration within a team. For this MLOps project, which aims to create a Real-Time NFL Game Sentiment Analyzer, a coherent file structure supports the project's main goals—predicting NFL game outcomes and providing insights via a real-time interactive dashboard and API. This document outlines the project’s file organization, ensuring clarity and accessibility for future developers and stakeholders, fostering a collaborative environment.

### Overview of the Tech Stack

The project employs a mix of modern technologies to accomplish its objectives. The frontend is developed using React for dynamic user interfaces, while the backend is managed with Node.js for API development, and Python for machine learning model handling. Additionally, MongoDB serves as the database for storing historical sentiment data. The use of JWT or OAuth provides secure user authentication. MLOps best practices are adhered to using Hopsworks for feature storage, Weights & Biases for experiment tracking, and HuggingFace for model deployment. This diverse tech stack requires a thoughtful file structure that can support different technologies and facilitate smooth communication between the frontend, backend, and data layers.

### Root Directory Structure

At the root level, the project is organized into major directories and files crucial for the development and maintenance of the application. These include:

*   `frontend/`: This directory contains the code related to the frontend React application.
*   `backend/`: Housing the Node.js and Python components for API and model handling.
*   `data/`: Contains initial dataset scripts and any required configuration for data access.
*   `config/`: Holds configuration files such as environment variables.
*   `scripts/`: Includes useful scripts for automation, such as deployment or data fetching.
*   Important files like `README.md` for documentation and `package.json` for managing Node.js dependencies are also present at this level.

### Frontend File Structure

In the `frontend/` directory, the React application is divided into logical subdirectories:

*   `src/`: This is the main source directory containing the application code.

    *   `components/`: Modular React components that make up the user interface.
    *   `styles/`: Centralized styling, ensuring a consistent look across the application.
    *   `assets/`: Images and other static files used in the application.
    *   `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for encapsulating complex logic.

*   `public/`: Contains static files such as HTML and favicon.

This structure supports modularity and reusability, allowing components to be maintained and expanded with minimal disruption.

### Backend File Structure

Under the `backend/` directory, you'll find the organization supporting the API and model functionality:

*   `app/`: Main application logic including API endpoints and business logic.

    *   `routes/`: Defines the API endpoints accessed by the frontend.
    *   `controllers/`: Control the application logic related to each route.
    *   `models/`: Defines data models and schemas for MongoDB.
    *   `services/`: Encapsulate business logic that interacts with models.

*   `ml/`: Houses the Python scripts for sentiment analysis and model management.

    *   `models/`: Pre-trained models and scripts for retraining and inference.
    *   `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experiment documentation.

This backend structure ensures maintainability and scalability by separating concerns and encapsulating different logic sections properly.

### Configuration and Environment Files

Configuration and environment settings are essential for adapting the project to different environments, such as development, testing, and production:

*   `.env`: A file in the `config/` directory that holds environment variables required for different services and settings.
*   `config.js`: Centralized configuration file that exports settings from the `.env` file to the application.
*   `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`: Provide containerization setup for consistent deployment environments.

These files play a vital role in ensuring that the correct configurations are loaded into the application at runtime.

### Testing and Documentation Structure

To guarantee quality assurance and effective knowledge transfer, testing and documentation files are organized as follows:

*   `tests/`: Dedicated directory containing unit and integration tests, ensuring code reliability and performance.
*   `docs/`: Contains additional documentation and guides, which complement the primary `README.md`.

A clear testing and documentation framework supports continuous integration practices, contributing to long-term maintenance and onboarding processes.

### Conclusion and Overall Summary

The well-organized file structure delineated in this document provides the framework necessary to support efficient development, deployment, and maintenance of the Real-Time NFL Game Sentiment Analyzer. By aligning with the tools and technologies utilized, this structure aids in fostering collaboration, simplifying onboarding for new developers, and ensuring the scalability of the system. Unique aspects like the integration of MLOps best practices further qualify the file organization as a model setup for robust, production-grade projects.
