# Frontend Test Infrastructure Improvements - Requirements

## Introduction

The frontend test suite currently has significant issues with 65 failed tests and 9 failed snapshots. This spec addresses systematic improvements to the testing infrastructure to ensure reliable, maintainable, and comprehensive test coverage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Testing Library Query Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable DOM queries in tests so that tests accurately reflect component behavior and don't fail due to timing or rendering issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test queries for dynamic content THEN the test SHALL use appropriate waiting strategies (waitFor, findBy queries)
2. WHEN testing WebSocket connection states THEN the test SHALL properly mock connection lifecycle events
3. WHEN testing loading states THEN the test SHALL account for asynchronous state transitions
4. IF a component renders conditionally THEN the test SHALL verify the condition before querying elements

### Requirement 2: Resolve Visual Regression Test Failures

**User Story:** As a developer, I want stable visual regression tests so that UI changes are properly tracked without false positives from environmental differences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN snapshot tests run THEN they SHALL produce consistent results across different environments
2. WHEN component props change THEN snapshots SHALL be updated to reflect intentional changes
3. WHEN running in CI THEN snapshot tests SHALL not fail due to environment-specific rendering differences
4. IF snapshots are outdated THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on updating them

### Requirement 3: Improve WebSocket Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable WebSocket testing so that real-time features are properly tested without flaky network dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing WebSocket connections THEN the test SHALL use proper mock implementations
2. WHEN testing connection states THEN the test SHALL simulate all connection lifecycle events
3. WHEN testing message handling THEN the test SHALL verify message processing without actual network calls
4. IF WebSocket errors occur THEN the test SHALL verify proper error handling and recovery

### Requirement 4: Fix Accessibility Test Violations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want accessibility-compliant components so that the application is usable by all users and meets WCAG standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form controls are rendered THEN they SHALL have proper labels or ARIA attributes
2. WHEN buttons are rendered THEN they SHALL have accessible names or text content
3. WHEN interactive elements are rendered THEN they SHALL be keyboard accessible
4. IF accessibility violations exist THEN the test SHALL provide specific remediation guidance

### Requirement 5: Modernize React Testing Practices

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modern React testing practices so that tests are maintainable and follow current best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing state updates THEN the test SHALL wrap updates in act() calls
2. WHEN using deprecated APIs THEN the test SHALL migrate to modern alternatives
3. WHEN testing async operations THEN the test SHALL properly handle React's concurrent features
4. IF React warnings occur THEN the test SHALL address the underlying issues

### Requirement 6: Enhance Test Reliability and Performance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want fast and reliable tests so that the development workflow is efficient and CI/CD pipelines are stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL complete within reasonable time limits
2. WHEN tests are flaky THEN the system SHALL identify and fix the root causes
3. WHEN mocking external dependencies THEN mocks SHALL be consistent and realistic
4. IF tests fail intermittently THEN the system SHALL provide debugging information
