# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the project's linting configuration by refining the global ignore list in `.flake8` to reduce false negatives and improve code quality detection. The current configuration suppresses several important error codes globally, which can hide legitimate issues like dead code, unused imports, and formatting problems across the entire codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the linting configuration to catch unused imports and variables in most files, so that I can identify and remove dead code that clutters the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN linting runs THEN F401 (unused imports) SHALL only be ignored in specific file patterns where re-exports are intentional
2. WHEN linting runs THEN F841 (unused variables) SHALL only be ignored in test files and other specific contexts where temporary variables are acceptable
3. WHEN linting runs in production code THEN unused imports and variables SHALL be flagged as violations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code formatting to be enforced, so that the codebase maintains a professional appearance and reduces diff noise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN linting runs THEN W291 (trailing whitespace) SHALL be flagged as a violation
2. WHEN code is committed THEN trailing whitespace SHALL be automatically handled by formatters and editors
3. WHEN linting configuration is updated THEN deprecated rules SHALL be removed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the linting configuration to follow current Python standards, so that the project adheres to modern best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating the ignore list THEN W503 SHALL be removed since PEP 8 now prefers line breaks before binary operators
2. WHEN linting runs THEN only necessary and justified ignore codes SHALL be globally suppressed
3. WHEN specific files need exceptions THEN per-file-ignores SHALL be used instead of global suppression

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain existing legitimate exceptions, so that files with valid reasons for ignoring certain rules continue to work without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating the configuration THEN existing per-file-ignores for `__init__.py` files SHALL be preserved for F401
2. WHEN updating the configuration THEN migration files SHALL continue to ignore line length and import rules
3. WHEN updating the configuration THEN test files SHALL have appropriate exceptions for testing-specific patterns
4. WHEN updating the configuration THEN script files SHALL maintain their import order exceptions where needed
