# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The NFL Sentiment Analyzer currently has a basic FastAPI backend with simple sentiment analysis capabilities, but lacks many of the features described in its documentation. This improvement plan aims to align the actual implementation with the documented vision, creating a comprehensive real-time NFL sentiment analysis platform with proper MLOps practices, user authentication, and data integrations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Frontend Development

**User Story:** As an NFL fan, I want an interactive web dashboard so that I can visualize real-time sentiment analysis and betting insights in an intuitive interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display a React-based dashboard with real-time NFL sentiment data
2. WHEN sentiment data updates THEN the dashboard SHALL automatically refresh without requiring page reload
3. WHEN a user views the dashboard on mobile THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface optimized for mobile devices
4. WHEN a user interacts with visualizations THEN the system SHALL provide interactive charts showing sentiment trends over time

### Requirement 2: User Authentication System

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want secure user authentication so that I can control access to premium features and maintain user sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL create a secure account using OAuth or JWT authentication
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL validate credentials and establish a secure session
3. WHEN an admin user accesses the system THEN the system SHALL provide additional administrative capabilities
4. WHEN a user session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication before accessing protected resources

### Requirement 3: Real-time Data Integration

**User Story:** As an NFL analyst, I want real-time data from multiple sources so that I can get comprehensive sentiment analysis based on current events and social media.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NFL-related content is posted on social media THEN the system SHALL collect and process relevant tweets and posts
2. WHEN new NFL news is published THEN the system SHALL fetch data from ESPN and other sports APIs
3. WHEN betting lines change THEN the system SHALL update odds information from DraftKings and MGM Sportsbook APIs
4. WHEN data is collected THEN the system SHALL process it within 30 seconds for real-time analysis

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Sentiment Analysis

**User Story:** As a sports bettor, I want advanced NFL-specific sentiment analysis so that I can make informed betting decisions based on market sentiment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text data is analyzed THEN the system SHALL use NFL-specific trained models for more accurate sentiment scoring
2. WHEN analyzing team-specific content THEN the system SHALL categorize sentiment by team, player, and game context
3. WHEN processing betting-related content THEN the system SHALL identify and weight sentiment related to betting lines and predictions
4. WHEN sentiment analysis completes THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores and contextual insights

### Requirement 5: MLOps Pipeline Implementation

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want automated model management and monitoring so that the sentiment analysis models remain accurate and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new training data becomes available THEN the system SHALL automatically retrain models using MLOps best practices
2. WHEN model performance degrades THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts and initiate retraining workflows
3. WHEN models are deployed THEN the system SHALL use Hopsworks for feature storage and HuggingFace for model serving
4. WHEN experiments are conducted THEN the system SHALL track results using Weights & Biases for reproducibility

### Requirement 6: API Enhancement and Documentation

**User Story:** As a third-party developer, I want comprehensive API endpoints with proper documentation so that I can integrate NFL sentiment data into my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the API THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints for team-specific, player-specific, and game-specific sentiment analysis
2. WHEN API documentation is requested THEN the system SHALL serve comprehensive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL implement proper rate limiting and authentication
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return meaningful error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes

### Requirement 7: Data Storage and Analytics

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want efficient data storage and historical analytics so that I can track sentiment trends and system performance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sentiment data is generated THEN the system SHALL store it efficiently in MongoDB with proper indexing
2. WHEN historical data is requested THEN the system SHALL provide fast queries for trend analysis
3. WHEN data volume grows THEN the system SHALL implement data archiving and cleanup strategies
4. WHEN analytics are needed THEN the system SHALL provide aggregated sentiment metrics by team, player, and time period

### Requirement 8: Infrastructure and Deployment

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want containerized deployment with proper environment management so that the application can be deployed consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL use Docker containers for both frontend and backend services
2. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN the system SHALL properly manage secrets and configuration
3. WHEN scaling is required THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling of API services
4. WHEN monitoring is needed THEN the system SHALL provide health checks and logging for all services
