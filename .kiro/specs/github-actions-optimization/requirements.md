# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues with the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline where all workflows are failing when pushing changes, and there are duplicate workflow triggers. The solution involves fixing the failing workflows and removing problematic test jobs (`test-backend`, `test-frontend`, and `lint-and-format`) to create a stable, minimal CI pipeline.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix the failing GitHub Actions workflows so that the CI pipeline runs successfully when I push changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main or dev branches THEN the GitHub Actions workflow SHALL complete successfully
2. WHEN a pull request is created or updated THEN the workflow SHALL run without failures
3. WHEN examining workflow runs THEN there SHALL be no failing jobs due to configuration errors
4. WHEN the workflow executes THEN all remaining jobs SHALL pass their health checks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate duplicate GitHub Actions triggers so that workflows run only once per event and don't waste CI/CD resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created or updated THEN the GitHub Actions workflow SHALL run only once
2. WHEN code is pushed to main or dev branches THEN the workflow SHALL trigger only once per push
3. WHEN examining the workflow configuration THEN there SHALL be no duplicate or conflicting trigger conditions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove the test-backend job from the CI pipeline so that backend testing failures don't block the workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GitHub Actions workflow runs THEN it SHALL NOT execute the test-backend job
2. WHEN examining the workflow file THEN the test-backend job definition SHALL be completely removed
3. WHEN the workflow completes THEN no backend test dependencies SHALL be required

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove the test-frontend job from the CI pipeline so that frontend testing failures don't block the workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GitHub Actions workflow runs THEN it SHALL NOT execute the test-frontend job
2. WHEN examining the workflow file THEN the test-frontend job definition SHALL be completely removed
3. WHEN the workflow completes THEN no frontend test dependencies SHALL be required

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove the lint-and-format job from the CI pipeline so that linting failures don't block the workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GitHub Actions workflow runs THEN it SHALL NOT execute the lint-and-format job
2. WHEN examining the workflow file THEN the lint-and-format job definition SHALL be completely removed
3. WHEN the workflow completes THEN no linting or formatting checks SHALL be performed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simplified build job that runs independently so that the CI pipeline focuses only on essential build verification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build job runs THEN it SHALL NOT depend on any test or lint jobs
2. WHEN the workflow executes THEN the build job SHALL run immediately after checkout
3. WHEN the build completes successfully THEN it SHALL verify that the Docker image can be built
4. IF the build job fails THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages for debugging
