# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical GitHub Actions workflow failures that are preventing successful CI/CD pipeline execution. The current issues include deprecated CodeQL Action versions and missing development dependency files, which are blocking automated security scanning and testing processes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want GitHub Actions workflows to use supported CodeQL Action versions, so that security scanning continues to function without deprecation warnings or failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GitHub Actions workflow runs THEN the system SHALL use CodeQL Action v3 instead of deprecated v1/v2 versions
2. WHEN CodeQL security scanning executes THEN the system SHALL successfully upload SARIF results without "Resource not accessible by integration" errors
3. WHEN workflows complete THEN the system SHALL not display deprecation warnings for CodeQL Actions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want development dependencies to be properly configured for uv package manager, so that GitHub Actions can install required packages for testing and development workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub Actions attempts to install development dependencies THEN the system SHALL use uv package manager instead of pip
2. WHEN uv install runs in CI THEN the system SHALL successfully install all development dependencies from pyproject.toml without file not found errors
3. WHEN development workflows execute THEN the system SHALL have access to all necessary testing and linting tools through uv-managed dependencies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want GitHub Actions workflows to have proper permissions, so that security scanning and other integrations can access necessary resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CodeQL Action attempts to upload results THEN the system SHALL have sufficient permissions to access GitHub's security features
2. WHEN workflows run THEN the system SHALL not encounter "Resource not accessible by integration" permission errors
3. WHEN security scanning completes THEN the system SHALL successfully integrate results with GitHub's security dashboard
