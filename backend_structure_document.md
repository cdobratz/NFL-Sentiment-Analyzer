# Backend Structure Document: Real-Time NFL Game Sentiment Analyzer

## Introduction

The backend of the Real-Time NFL Game Sentiment Analyzer plays a crucial role in processing and analyzing data, managing interactions through APIs, and maintaining the system's reliability and efficiency. This document outlines the backend architecture and infrastructure to ensure seamless operation of the sentiment analysis tool. This tool aims to predict market sentiment for NFL enthusiasts and gamblers by analyzing data from tweets and news, supporting both an API and an interactive dashboard.

## Backend Architecture

The backend architecture leverages a combination of Node.js and Python, serving distinct roles in API development and machine learning model execution, respectively. The design follows a microservices pattern, allowing different components of the system to remain modular and scalable. Node.js handles API requests and data routing, while Python manages heavy computational tasks related to machine learning. This separation of concerns facilitates scalability by allowing the independent scaling of services based on demand.

## Database Management

MongoDB serves as the primary database solution for storing historical sentiment analysis data. As a NoSQL database, MongoDB supports flexible data models and high performance, which is essential for real-time data storage and retrieval. Data is structured in collections representing different data sources and processed outcomes. Access to this data is facilitated through efficient query mechanisms, ensuring quick retrieval times aligned with real-time processing needs.

## API Design and Endpoints

The API design follows RESTful principles, enabling seamless interaction with the dashboard and external clients. Key endpoints are defined for accessing sentiment predictions, managing user authentication, and retrieving betting line data. These endpoints ensure smooth data flow between the frontend, NLP models, and third-party services. Interactive documentation developed using Swagger provides clear guidelines for API usage, enhancing developer experience.
