# Project Requirements Document: Real-Time NFL Game Sentiment Analyzer

## 1. Project Overview

The Real-Time NFL Game Sentiment Analyzer is designed to deliver an insightful and interactive platform for NFL fans and sports gamblers. The primary objective is to analyze live betting market tweets and news to predict market sentiment surrounding NFL games. This project will integrate machine learning operations (MLOps) best practices to maintain high performance in continuous deployment and monitoring, showcasing these techniques in both an API and an interactive dashboard format.

The tool is being built to cater to NFL enthusiasts and gamblers who seek to leverage technology for smarter wagering decisions. Success for this project means providing accurate sentiment analysis that helps users place informed bets, while demonstrating end-to-end MLOps excellence from data collection to retraining models. Over time, this platform aims to be a top choice for users seeking reliable NFL sentiment insights.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope

*   Development of a responsive dashboard with NFL sentiment analysis and betting line predictions.
*   API offering sentiment predictions for integration with third-party services.
*   Real-time data collection from sources like X platform (formerly Twitter) and ESPN.
*   Sentiment analysis using natural language processing and machine learning models in Python.
*   Integration with Hopsworks for feature storage, Weights & Biases for experiment tracking, and HuggingFace for model deployment.

### Out-of-Scope

*   Monetization features or paid user tiers beyond initial MVP offering.
*   Mobile application development outside the scope of the desktop-optimized web dashboard.
*   Historical data analysis beyond rate-limited API offerings.
*   Any form of betting or gambling service functionality.

## 3. User Flow

In a typical user journey, a new user lands on the main dashboard, which displays an intuitive layout of real-time NFL game sentiment analytics. The dashboard showcases betting lines from several top gambling sites along with sentiment analysis derived from sports writers, NFL influencers, and key athlete updates. Crucially, users also see a consolidated injury report updating regularly as new data arrives, while an interactive visualization helps users quickly interpret the predictions.

For admin users, an exclusive interface is accessible that provides additional capabilities such as managing user data access, monitoring system health, and overseeing incoming data from integrated sports platforms. The dashboard is designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring seamless usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 4. Core Features (Bullet Points)

*   **User Authentication**: Simple and secure login process using OAuth for secure access.
*   **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time updates on sentiment and predictions with responsive design elements.
*   **Admin Interface**: Role management for data access control and system monitoring.
*   **Sentiment Analysis**: Advanced NLP and ML techniques in Python to assess live sentiment.
*   **Data Integration**: Fetches and processes data from various sports-related APIs.
*   **API Endpoints**: Offers access to sentiment prediction data for external integrations.
*   **MLOps Integration**: Automates deployments, monitoring, and retraining for model accuracy maintenance.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend**: React for building the user interface with supporting responsive frameworks.
*   **Backend**: Python for API development and machine learning components.
*   **Database**: MongoDB to store historical sentiment analysis data.
*   **Data Integration**: Hopsworks for feature storage and Weights & Biases for experiment tracking.
*   **Model Serving**: HuggingFace utilizing Python for deploying machine learning models.
*   **Third-Party APIs**: X platform for sentiment data and ESPN for NFL game, odds, and matchup information.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance**: Expected to handle bursts of traffic before game timings with redundancy mechanisms.
*   **Security**: Enforce user data protection through secure communication protocols and robust authentication.
*   **Compliance**: Adherence to data privacy regulations, especially concerning user data handling.
*   **Usability**: Intuitive interface design to cater to users of varying tech-savvy levels.
*   **Documentation**: Clear API documentation using tools like Swagger to ensure ease of use.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Dependence on Third-Party APIs**: Limited by the rate and availability of API data from X platform and sports websites.
*   **Avialability of Claude AI**: Reliant on continuous support for code assistance operations.
*   **Assumption**: Users will primarily engage with the platform before major NFL games.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits**: Risk of hitting usage limits on data sources like X platform and sports APIs.

    *   **Mitigation**: Implement data caching and buffer strategies to maximize available data.

*   **Model Performance Dips**: Python ML models may need frequent updates to remain accurate with new data streams.

    *   **Mitigation**: Utilize MLOps practices like automated retraining and continuous monitoring.

*   **User Engagement**: Initially, engagement may be less than expected.

    *   **Mitigation**: Promote through social media and NFL fan channels to drive awareness.
