# NFL Sentiment Analyzer

A real-time sentiment analysis tool for NFL games that helps fans and analysts understand the public sentiment around games, teams, and players. Built with modern MLOps practices and scalable architecture.

## üèà Features

- Real-time sentiment analysis of NFL-related content
- FastAPI backend with MongoDB Atlas integration
- Containerized with Docker for easy deployment
- Scalable architecture ready for high-traffic game days

## ‚ú® Recent Improvements

- **Enhanced Security**: Replaced dangerous `redis.flushdb()` with safe prefix-based key deletion to prevent accidental data loss in shared Redis instances
- **Performance Optimization**: Improved MongoDB query efficiency by using direct integer equality instead of `$in` operators for better index utilization
- **Bug Fixes**: Fixed CORS validator to properly read environment settings from `.env` files using Pydantic's ValidationInfo
- **CI/CD Improvements**: Resolved NumPy 2.0 compatibility issues in test suite and updated Docker builds to use UV package manager
- **Code Quality**: Applied Black formatting and improved test reliability with tolerance-based floating-point comparisons
